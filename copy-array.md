#Copy Array
Write a program to copy content of array `a` to array `b`.

*Description*: Given two array `a` and `b`, let `a[] = {2, 4, 5, 6}` and `b` is unknown. When we execute copy operation - `a` 
would be unchanged but content of `b` would be {2, 4, 5, 6}.

*Task* - Complete following copy function (Assume that size of `b` is always larger than that of `a`):

```C
void copy(int* a, int* b, int size) {

}
```
